            <p class="main__parrafo--derecha">On his eleventh birthday he learns that he is a wizard, and the plot of the books focuses primarily on the years in which the orphan Potter attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to practice under the guidance of headmaster Albus Dumbledore and other teachers. There, Harry also discovers that he is already famous throughout the wizarding world and that his destiny is tied to that of Lord Voldemort, the world-feared dark wizard and murderer of his mother and father.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="background__transparent main__personajes__par" id="HermioneGranger">
            <p class="main__parrafo--derecha">She appears in the first novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, as a new student on her way to Hogwarts. After Harry and Ron saved her from a mountain troll in the girls' baths, a close friendship forms between them and she often uses her quick wit and encyclopedic knowledge to help them.
                Rowling has stated that Hermione resembles her at a younger age, with her insecurity and fear of failure. Her role is quite decisive since, having good study skills, she could be considered the "brain" of the group, even being the advisor to her friend Harry Potter in his leadership of Dumbledore's Army.
                Hermione is the most intelligent girl in her year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Like Harry and Ron, she belongs to the Gryffindor house, although the Sorting Hat considered placing her in Ravenclaw due to her prominent intellectual abilities. Hermione is of Muggle origin: her parents are both dentists and have no connection to the wizarding world. She loves to read, however, she cannot draw. She does not like to break the rules except in an emergency and is not particularly enthusiastic about Quidditch, the wizarding sport, although she supports her friends during the championship. She tends to believe that everything worth knowing can be learned from a book and is sceptical about anything that cannot be proven with science, therefore despising the Divination subject taught by Professor Sybill Trelawney. Hermione met Harry Potter and Ron Weasley on the Hogwarts Express.</p>

            <p class="main__parrafo--derecha">He is the sixth of seven Weasley children. He is the son of Arthur and Molly Weasley and brother of Bill, Charlie, Percy, twins Fred and George and little Ginny.
                His father works at the Ministry of Magic, while his mother is a housewife. Bill works for the wizard bank in Egypt and Charlie breeds dragons in Romania. Percy is an assistant to the Minister of Magic and the twins end up opening the joke shop Weasley's Wizard Wheezes. Finally, his younger sister Ginny ends up being the captain of the Holyhead Harpies Quidditch team.
                Poor but honest, the Weasley brothers have always bought second-hand things, despite the fact that Aunt Muriel is very well off financially, as she owns a mansion where they end up hiding from Voldemort and his henchmen. The paternal grandparents are Septimus Weasley and Cedrella Black, while the maternal grandparents are Ignatius Prewett and Lucretia Black.
                Married to his friend Hermione, the couple has two children: Rose and Hugo Granger-Weasley.</p>

        <div class="background__transparent main__personajes__par" id="LordVoldemort">
            <p class="main__parrafo--derecha">Voldemort first appears in the novel that begins the series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, the first part of the heptalogy. He is the last descendant of Salazar Slytherin, one of the founders of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

                In the story, Voldemort is Harry Potter's main enemy, who according to a prophecy, has the power to defeat him. The magical community fears Voldemort so much that they prefer to refer to him as "You-Know-Who", "He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named", or the "Unnameable". Although in the first magical war it was different (the Death Eaters touched the Dark Mark) in the seventh book it is explained that this fear was due to the fact that at the time of Voldemort's greatest prosperity, the Death Eaters could instantly know the location of whoever said the name "Voldemort", a curse that occurs again in the Second Wizarding War. The fear that Voldemort's name inspires is such that even his own followers refer to him as "Dark Lord", "Lord of Darkness" or "Dark Lord", or directly to him as "My Lord", "My Master" or "My Lord".</p>

            <h2 class="main__subtitulo">Albus Dumbledore</h2>
            <img src="../imagenes/albusdumbledore.png" alt="Imagen que contiene a Albus Dumbledore" class="main__foto--izquierda">
            <p class="main__parrafo--derecha">Professor Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore was the Transfiguration professor and later Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Albus Dumbledore was considered to be the most powerful wizard of his time. He was famous for defeating Gellert Grindelwald, discovering twelve uses of dragon's blood, and his work in alchemy with Nicolas Flamel.

                It was through Albus that the resistance to the rise of Lord Voldemort was formed, as it was he who founded and led the first and second Order of the Phoenix. Due to the fact that he had a keen mind, great bravery, and legendary power, Albus Dumbledore became the only wizard that Voldemort ever feared. He was the wielder of the Elder Wand from 1945 to 1997, and was considered by many to be the best headmaster Hogwarts had ever had. When he was close to death from a cursed ring, he plotted his own death along with Severus Snape. Although he was no longer alive at the time, it was through Albus' machinations that Voldemort was eventually defeated and peace restored to the wizarding world. He is the only headmaster to be entombed at Hogwarts. A portrait of Albus Dumbledore still stands in the headmaster's office.</p>
